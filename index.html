    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <i>
      I come from a big family. I have four sisters and three brothers. I love swimming and hanging
     out with them. I'm 25 years old and I like to garden and play with my puppy in my free time.
      I'm excited to get valuable skills that will make me more employable from Kenzie Academy &#160; &#174;&#160;.

    <h2><strong>Short Story</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>The CEO pulled in over three-hundred thousand dollars a year. He ruled over a company of 
    peons two-hundred-and-fifty souls strong, owned two spacious homes, captained his own yacht
     on the weekends, and had recently dined with a world leader of no small repute. </strong> He was a 
     mover and a shaker, a rags-to-riches story worthy of committing even the savviest financial
      advisor to a blush. The bird shit upon the CEO's tailored suit anyway, <b>unimpressed</b>.

    <h3>Don't believe every headline you see!</h3>
    <p>The Snopes.com web site was founded by David Mikkelson, a project begun in 1994 as an 
    expression of his interest in researching urban legends that has since grown into the oldest 
    and largest fact-checking site on the Internet — one widely regarded by journalists, folklorists,
     and laypersons alike as one of the world’s essential resources. Snopes.com is routinely included
      in annual “Best of the Web” lists and has been the recipient of two Webby awards.
